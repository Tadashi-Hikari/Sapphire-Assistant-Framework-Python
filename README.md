# Assistant

A customizable personal assistant program, mostly written in Python, designed with the Unix philosophy in mind. Modular, for replacement with custom components. Meant to be an assistant fitted to an individual, not a generic assistant for everybody. 

Primary features of this are that it is designed to work offline without registration with any services, can be networked with other instances of the assistant, and is designed to be tailored to the user (rather than be a generic experince for all users (like some other assisstants))
